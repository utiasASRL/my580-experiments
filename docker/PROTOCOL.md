# Dataset collection Wednesday May 10

Notes of anything important that happened during data collection.

first round
===========

- loop2d 
- loop2d fast
changed to facing down more
- loop2d-fast-v2
from somewhere here didn't restart the nodes
- loop2d-v2
- loop3d (two loops, with circular egomotion)
- loop3d-v2 (three loops, without circular egomotion)

testing
========
did a few tests with anchors 6 which was bad, in the end we swtiched 6 and 12 and noticed that 6 was still bad, so it was actually tag-dependent. 

second round
============
then recorded loop2d-v3 again, with everything on a higher stick.
same for other datasets with v3. 
also recorded zigzag and eight for the first time. 

observations from second round: probably a lot of nlos for tag10
tag6 tilted a little bit
